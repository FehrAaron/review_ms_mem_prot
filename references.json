Here, IC‐FPOMP (in‐cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC‐FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanoparticles or H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96‐well plate platform, high‐throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC‐FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter‐hGLUT1 and human gamma‐glutamyl carboxylase‐hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter‘s conformation differently. In‐cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug‐binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC‐FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure‐function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.</jats:p>",

Despite its great significance, ligand discovery against membrane proteins has posed a great challenge mainly due to the special property of their natural habitat. Here, we design a new chemical proteomic probe OPA-S-S-alkyne that can efficiently and selectively target the lysines exposed on the cell surface and develop a chemical proteomics strategy for global analysis of surface functionality (GASF) in living cells. In total, we quantified 2639 cell surface lysines in Hela cell and several hundred residues with high reactivity were discovered, which represents the largest dataset of surface functional lysine sites to date. We discovered and validated that hyper-reactive lysine residues K382 on tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) and K285 on Endoglin (ENG/CD105) are at the protein interaction interface in co-crystal structures of protein complexes, emphasizing the broad potential functional consequences of cell surface lysines and GASF strategy is highly desirable for discovering new active and ligandable sites that can be functionally interrogated for drug discovery.</jats:p>",

However, many spatial proteomics methods are limited in their ability to resolve organellar sub-compartments, profile multiple sub-compartments in parallel, and/or characterize membrane-associated proteomes. Here, we develop a cross-link assisted spatial proteomics (CLASP) strategy that addresses these shortcomings. Using human mitochondria as a model system, we show that CLASP can elucidate spatial proteomes of all mitochondrial sub-compartments and provide topological insight into the mitochondrial membrane proteome. Biochemical and imaging-based follow-up studies confirm that CLASP allows discovering mitochondria-associated proteins and revising previous protein sub-compartment localization and membrane topology data. We also validate the CLASP concept in synaptic vesicles, demonstrating its applicability to different sub-cellular compartments. This study extends the scope of cross-linking mass spectrometry beyond protein structure and interaction analysis towards spatial proteomics, and establishes a method for concomitant profiling of sub-organelle and membrane proteomes.</jats:p>",

Despite multiple studies shedding light on MsbA, the role of lipids in modulating MsbA-nucleotide interactions remains poorly understood. Here we use native mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate and resolve nucleotide and lipid binding to MsbA, demonstrating that the transporter has a higher affinity for adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP). Moreover, native MS shows the LPS-precursor 3-deoxy-D-<jats:italic>manno</jats:italic>-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-lipid A (KDL) can tune the selectivity of MsbA for adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) over ADP. Guided by these studies, four open, inward-facing structures of MsbA are determined that vary in their openness. We also report a 2.7 Å-resolution structure of MsbA in an open, outward-facing conformation that is not only bound to KDL at the exterior site, but with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) adopting a distinct nucleotide-free structure. The results obtained from this study offer valuable insight and snapshots of MsbA during the transport cycle.</jats:p>",

Recent progress has yielded atomic structures of key intermediates<jats:sup>1,2</jats:sup> and roles for lipids in signalling<jats:sup>3,4</jats:sup>. However, capturing signalling events of a wild-type receptor in real time, across a native membrane to its downstream effectors, has remained elusive. Here we probe the archetypal class A GPCR, rhodopsin, directly from fragments of native disc membranes using mass spectrometry. We monitor real-time photoconversion of dark-adapted rhodopsin to opsin, delineating retinal isomerization and hydrolysis steps, and further showing that the reaction is significantly slower in its native membrane than in detergent micelles. Considering the lipids ejected with rhodopsin, we demonstrate that opsin can be regenerated in membranes through photoisomerized retinal–lipid conjugates, and we provide evidence for increased association of rhodopsin with unsaturated long-chain phosphatidylcholine during signalling. Capturing the secondary steps of the signalling cascade, we monitor light activation of transducin (G<jats:sub>t</jats:sub>) through loss of GDP to generate an intermediate apo-trimeric G protein, and observe Gα<jats:sub>t</jats:sub>•GTP subunits interacting with PDE6 to hydrolyse cyclic GMP. We also show how rhodopsin-targeting compounds either stimulate or dampen signalling through rhodopsin–opsin and transducin signalling pathways. Our results not only reveal the effect of native lipids on rhodopsin signalling and regeneration but also enable us to propose a paradigm for GPCR drug discovery in native membrane environments.</jats:p>",

Despite the importance of AC8 in physiology, the structural basis of its regulation by G proteins and CaM is not well defined. Here, we report the 3.5 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the bovine AC8 bound to the stimulatory Gαs protein in the presence of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>/CaM. The structure reveals the architecture of the ordered AC8 domains bound to Gαs and the small molecule activator forskolin. The extracellular surface of AC8 features a negatively charged pocket, a potential site for unknown interactors. Despite the well-resolved forskolin density, the captured state of AC8 does not favour tight nucleotide binding. The structural proteomics approaches, limited proteolysis and crosslinking mass spectrometry (LiP-MS and XL-MS), allowed us to identify the contact sites between AC8 and its regulators, CaM, Gαs, and Gβγ, as well as to infer the conformational changes induced by these interactions. Our results provide a framework for understanding the role of flexible regions in the mechanism of AC regulation.</jats:p>",

We introduced a scalable PL pipeline integrating automated enrichment of biotinylated proteins in a 96-well plate format. Combining this with optimized quantitative MS based on data-independent acquisition (DIA), we increased sample throughput and improved protein identification and quantification reproducibility. We applied this pipeline to delineate subcellular proteomes across various compartments. Using the 5HT<jats:sub>2A</jats:sub> serotonin receptor as a model, we studied temporal changes of proximal interaction networks induced by receptor activation. In addition, we modified the pipeline for reduced sample input to accommodate CRISPR-based gene knockout, assessing dynamics of the 5HT<jats:sub>2A</jats:sub> network in response to perturbation of selected interactors. This PL approach is universally applicable to PL proteomics using biotinylation-based PL enzymes, enhancing throughput and reproducibility of standard protocols.</jats:p>",

There are about 450 different SLCs, residing in a variety of subcellular membranes. Loss-of-function of an unusually high proportion of SLC transporters is genetically associated with a plethora of human diseases, making SLCs a rapidly emerging but challenging drug target class. Knowledge of their protein environment may elucidate the molecular basis for their functional integration with metabolic and cellular pathways and help conceive pharmacological interventions based on modulating proteostatic regulation. We aimed at obtaining a global survey of the SLC-protein interaction landscape and mapped the protein–protein interactions of 396 SLCs by interaction proteomics. We employed a functional assessment based on RNA interference of interactors in combination with measurement of protein stability and localization.

The structural basis of CaM regulation remains largely unexplored. In retinal photoreceptors, CaM binds to the CNGB subunit of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and, thereby, adjusts the channel’s Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) sensitivity in response to changes in ambient light conditions. Here, we provide the structural characterization for CaM regulation of a CNG channel by using a combination of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and structural proteomics. CaM connects the CNGA and CNGB subunits, resulting in structural changes both in the cytosolic and transmembrane regions of the channel. Cross-linking and limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry mapped the conformational changes induced by CaM in vitro and in the native membrane. We propose that CaM is a constitutive subunit of the rod channel to ensure high sensitivity in dim light. Our mass spectrometry-based approach is generally relevant for studying the effect of CaM on ion channels in tissues of medical interest, where only minute quantities are available.</jats:p>",

In situ labeling chemistries, most notably proximity-labeling interactomics are well suited to characterize these dynamic and often fleeting interactions. Established methods require distinct chemistries for proteins and lipids, which limits the scope of such studies. Here we establish a singlet-oxygen-based photocatalytic proximity labeling platform (POCA) that reports intracellular interactomes for both proteins and lipids with tight spatiotemporal resolution using cell-penetrant photosensitizer reagents. Using both physiologically relevant lipoprotein-complexed probe delivery and genetic manipulation of cellular cholesterol handling machinery, cholesterol-directed POCA captured established and unprecedented cholesterol binding proteins, including protein complexes sensitive to intracellular cholesterol levels and proteins uniquely captured by lipoprotein uptake. Protein-directed POCA accurately mapped known intracellular membrane complexes, defined sterol-dependent changes to the non-vesicular cholesterol transport protein interactome, and captured state-dependent changes in the interactome of the cholesterol transport protein Aster-B. More broadly, we find that POCA is a versatile interactomics platform that is straightforward to implement, using the readily available HaloTag system, and fulfills unmet needs in intracellular singlet oxygen-based proximity labeling proteomics. Thus, we expect widespread utility for POCA across a range of interactome applications, spanning imaging to proteomics.</jats:p>",

Peptide-centric local stability assay (PELSA) is a powerful tool for detecting these interactions and localizing potential binding sites. However, its original workflow is limited in throughput, sample compatibility and accessible protein targets. Here, we introduce a high-throughput adaptation - HT-PELSA - that increases sample processing efficiency 100-fold while maintaining high sensitivity and reproducibility. HT-PELSA substantially extends the capabilities of the original method by enabling sensitive protein-ligand profiling in crude cell, tissue and bacterial lysates, making it possible to identify membrane protein targets in diverse biological systems. We demonstrate that HT-PELSA can precisely and accurately determine binding affinities of small molecule inhibitors, sensitively detect direct and allosteric ATP binding, and reveal off-target interactions of a marketed kinase inhibitor in heart tissue. By enhancing scalability, reducing costs, and enabling system-wide drug screening across a wide range of sample types, HT-PELSA - when combined with next-generation mass spectrometry - offers a powerful platform poised to accelerate both drug discovery and basic biological research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Native mass spectrometry (MS) has become widely accepted in structural biology, providing information on stoichiometry, interactions, homogeneity, and shape of protein complexes. Yet, the fundamental assumption that proteins inside the mass spectrometer retain a structure faithful to native proteins in solution remains a matter of intense debate. Here, we reveal the gas-phase structure of β-galactosidase using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) down to 2.6-Å resolution, enabled by soft landing of mass-selected protein complexes onto cold transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids followed by in situ ice coating. We find that large parts of the secondary and tertiary structure are retained from the solution. Dehydration-driven subunit reorientation leads to consistent compaction in the gas phase. By providing a direct link between high-resolution imaging and the capability to handle and select protein complexes that behave problematically in conventional sample preparation, the approach has the potential to expand the scope of both native mass spectrometry and cryo-EM.</jats:p>",

We applied this platform to profile neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor and orthogonally validated more than 20 neighbors using immunoassays and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction. We further profiled the protein neighborhoods of cell-cell synapses induced by bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. This integrated multiscale PLP platform maps local and distal protein networks on and between cell surfaces, which will aid in the systematic construction of the cell surface interactome, revealing horizontal signaling partners and reveal new immunotherapeutic opportunities.</jats:p>",

ADCY5-catalyzed cAMP production was reduced with all three purine derivatives, while the most pronounced effects on cAMP reduction were observed for ADCY5 R418W mutant cells. The gain-of-function ADCY5 R418W mutant is characterized by an increased catalytic activity resulting in elevated cAMP levels that cause kinetic disorders or dyskinesia in patients. Based on our findings in ADCY5 cells, a slow-release formulation of theophylline was administered to a preschool-aged patient with ADCY5-related dyskinesia. A striking improvement of symptoms was observed, outperforming the effects of caffeine that had previously been administered to the same patient.

Although the vital role of ACs in cellular signalling is well established, the function of their transmembrane (TM) regions remains unknown. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of Cya bound to a stabilizing nanobody at 3.6 Å resolution. The TM helices 1–5 form a structurally conserved domain that facilitates the assembly of the helical and catalytic domains. The TM region contains discrete pockets accessible from the extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane. Neutralization of the negatively charged extracellular pocket Ex1 destabilizes the cytosolic helical domain and reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The TM domain acts as a functional component of Cya, guiding the assembly of the catalytic domain and providing the means for direct regulation of catalytic activity in response to extracellular ligands.</jats:p>",
